					<h3> New boho-chic jewelry trends: </h3>
					<p>Fast forward to the fall 2024 shows, and fashion is all caught up now, what with the flouncy blouses, leather capelets, golden and animal jewelry at Chemena Kamali’s Chloé debut. The jewelry stories on the fall runways contextualize the boho aesthetic in 2024. Animal motifs returned, but rather than kooky (and life-sized) snakes and lobsters or cutesy cows and dinosaur pins, Chloé revived its snake motif and cast mini horse heads out of antique gold, while Jonathan Anderson had tiny doves painted on signet rings.</p>

					<h3> Top Spring fashion trends:</h3>
					<p>New color codes for the minimalist, dramatic trench coats, and sheer delights for the dreamers and romantics in the room. A little white dress is nothing new for spring—but what is new is the way labels like Tove, The Row, and Ferragamo styled crisp cotton poplin to evoke that same easy, breezy sensation in in more modern form. You’ll find the same carefree vibe at Toteme, Cos, and Staud if you’re looking for something for everyday.</p>

					<h3> Trend From the Western:</h3>
					<p> If you’re not quite ready for a cowboy hat, perhaps the denim-vest trend will pique your interest. After all, vests have been having a moment for several seasons. The movement started with menswear-inspired suiting, but it has expanded into everyday-wear territory thanks to the laid-back denim assortment. Last season Sergio Hudson leaned into the Western-inspired trend, layering one over a shirt and tie. And in the resort 2024 collections, Dsquared2 offered a rock-and-roll take for the guys.
